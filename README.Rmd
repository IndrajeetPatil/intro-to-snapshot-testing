# Introduction to snapshot (aka golden) testing (in R)

In this presentation, I introduce what is snapshot testing, why is it necessary, and its implementation in R in `{testthat}` package and its extensions.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("media/logos_combined.jpeg")
```


In particular, the presentation provides a detailed account of how these tests are valuable in testing:

- text outputs
- graphical outputs
- Shiny apps
- entire files
