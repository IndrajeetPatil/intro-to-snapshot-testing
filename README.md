# Introduction to snapshot (aka) golden testing framework (in R)

In this presentation, I introduce what is snapshot testing and its implementation in `{testthat}` package in R.

In particular, I discuss how these tests are valuable in testing:

- text outputs
- graphical outputs
- Shiny apps
- entire files
- etc.
